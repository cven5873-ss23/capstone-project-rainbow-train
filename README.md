# Capstone Project

This repository is a template for the capstone project report that is due as the final assignment of the course. The data for the report was self-selected by students and submitted during week 3. Some data cleaning activities were performed by the course instructor, so that students all have an analysis-ready dataset at hand that follows tidy data principles and best practices for data organisation in spreadsheets.s
